## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository focused on building command-line interface (CLI) applications and experimenting with text-based user interfaces (TUIs). This space serves as a creative playground where I explore the power, simplicity, and versatility of terminal-based tools.

As a developer, Iâ€™m fascinated by how much can be accomplished within the terminalâ€”from lightweight utilities to full-featured interactive applications. CLI apps offer speed, scriptability, and low overhead, making them ideal for automation, system tools, and developer-facing utilities. TUIs, on the other hand, bring a visual layer to the terminal, allowing for more intuitive navigation and interaction while preserving the performance and portability of CLI tools.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find a mix of CLI tools and TUI prototypes, built using languages like Python, Go, and Rust, along with libraries such as curses, rich, blessed, tui-rs, and bubbletea. Projects range from file explorers and dashboards to task managers and utilities for data processing or system monitoring.

Each project emphasizes modular code, clean architecture, and practical features. Where possible, I include usage instructions, annotated code, and notes on design decisionsâ€”especially around input handling, layout management, and rendering performance. Accessibility, keyboard-first design, and cross-platform compatibility are key focuses.

This repository is a living collection of experiments and tools, aimed at anyone interested in the unique possibilities of the terminal. Whether you're a fellow developer exploring TUIs, someone who prefers the keyboard over the mouse, or just curious about building interactive terminal applications, I hope you find value here.

Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome. Thereâ€™s a lot of creativity to be found in text-based interfaces, and Iâ€™m excited to continue building and learning in this space.
